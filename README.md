# AI based offensive speech detection system

Offensive and hateful posts have become a critical problem in the social media domain. Political uprisings, insurrections, and bullying have been carried out using social media platforms. Hence, a system that automatically detects these inciteful posts and flags them before escalation is paramount. Artificial intelligence is becoming state of the art (SOTA), the latest being chat-GPT3 a conversational bot built on generative pre-trained transformer deep learning architecture. Algorithms like this can be harnessed in developing the SOTA classification system. This project focuses on implementing a deep learning system for text classification (offensive language detection). In this project, context-independent word embedding algorithms (word2vec, GloVe, and FastText) were used with BiLSTM a variant of RNN models. The BERT model (a contextdependent algorithm) was also implemented, and the performance of the systems was evaluated and compared. The GloVe + BiLSTM and BERT algorithms scored the best (95%) out of all after  being trained on tagged tweets from Twitter. The project aims to foster discussion and works on natural language processing within the research community.
